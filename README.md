# To-Do-List

This project is an object-oriented command-line style program that can be used as a To-Do List. You can create `Task`s and mark them complete or incomplete. You can also remove tasks from your `TaskList`.  
I practiced many C++ concepts by developing this project: classes, methods, pass-by-reference parameters, file linking.  
Also, I tried to adhere to Google's C++ programming style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming.
